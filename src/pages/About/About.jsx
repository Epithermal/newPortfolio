          Hi, I'm Callum from Scotland, A driven and optimistic IT professional with a deep passion for technology, problem-solving, and building efficient systems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white">
          My journey started during the COVID-19 lockdown when I self-taught programming and web development through online resources and real-world gigs on Fiverr. Since then, I've worked across several IT support roles, bringing energy and results to every position.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white">
          From resolving hundreds of backlog tickets at The Richmond Fellowship Scotland, to delivering on-site and remote support at Weatherproofing Advisors and [READACTED], I've built a strong foundation in both 1st and 2nd line support, asset management, and network troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white">
          I also develop websites and tools on the side, bringing fullstack knowledge and creative thinking to every project I take on. I'm always learning, growing, and pushing my limits â€” looking for new ways to make an impact in IT and software development.
